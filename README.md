# Face-Detection-With-LED
This project includes 'OpenCV Face Detection System'.
I've written this bunch of code to understand the basics of the OpenCV Face Detection, I've used an LED to prompt the user to see when his/her face is detected.
I also run this code on Raspberry Pi 3 B+, so you can see the 'PiCamera()' library at the top of the code. It means, you can use and run my code on your Raspberry to have fun with this great project.
